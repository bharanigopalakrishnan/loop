 # Flutter App Example

    This Flutter application demonstrates the use of provider for state management, and shared_preference for storing and retrieving data in local storage.

 ## Flutter version : 3.13.4

 ## Features
      
    Widget 1 displays the success count or Try Again message.

    Widget 2 is tappable and triggers the generation of a random number.

    If the random number displayed in Widget 3 matches the current seconds or hour part of the timestamp, Widget 1 displays a success message along with the total number of successful attempts since the app installation. Otherwise, it displays a try-again message.
